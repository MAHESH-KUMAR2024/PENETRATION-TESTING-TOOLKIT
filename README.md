# DESCRIPTION

# Task 3: Penetration Testing Toolkit
This toolkit includes multiple modules for network and web security testing, helping penetration testers identify vulnerabilities in systems and applications.

# Features Implemented
•Port Scanner → Scans for open ports on a target system.

•Brute-Forcer → Attempts to crack login credentials using dictionary attacks.

•Web Vulnerability Scanner → Detects SQL Injection, XSS, and security misconfigurations.

•Network Sniffer → Captures and analyzes network packets.

# Libraries Used
•socket → Performs network connections for port scanning.

•requests → Sends HTTP requests for web vulnerability scanning.

•BeautifulSoup → Extracts web forms for analysis.

•scapy → Captures network packets for sniffing.

•itertools & threading → Improves brute-force attack efficiency.

# How It Works
•The user selects a module (Port Scanner, Brute-Forcer, Web Scanner, or Network Sniffer).

•The chosen module runs tests on the target system or website.

•Port Scanner finds open ports that could be exploited.

•Brute-Forcer tries password lists against login pages or SSH services.

•Web Scanner identifies vulnerabilities in web applications.

•Network Sniffer captures and analyzes network traffic (requires admin privileges).

•Findings are reported, helping security professionals take action.

# Outcome
•A modular penetration testing toolkit for security analysis.

•Helps identify and exploit vulnerabilities in networks and applications.

•Useful for ethical hackers, security analysts, and cybersecurity researchers.
